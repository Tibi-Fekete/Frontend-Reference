Experimenting with color, different models were painted and then photographed. The aim of this portrait was to create a kind of still life with different levels and space for interpretation. What was important to me was the contrast between black and white and the reduction of the model (O'Neil Bürgi) to this contrast.",

            "description": "Every Wednesday at Spurgeons Academy, a school in the middle of the indecipherable maze of Kibera's narrow streets and alleys, students take the chairs and benches out of a classroom and sweep the floor. The school uniforms are switched to bright-colored clothes. When teacher Mike Wamaya enters the classroom, the students get into position and place one hand on the concrete wall as though it were a ballet bar. Classical music plays out of a small portable speaker, and the class begins. The Ballet class is part of Annos Africa and One Fine Days charity activities in slum areas around Kenya. In Nairobi, they work together with two schools in Kibera and one school in Mathare, another slum closer to the city center. The dance is a way for the children to express themselves and it strengthens their confidence in life, and a belief that they can become something great. Some of the children are now dancing several days a week in a studio called “Dance center Kenya” in an upper-class area of Nairobi and living in a boarding school, so thanks to their talent they have taken themselves away from the harsh conditions in the slum.",

One moment they might be utterly mischievous: nibbling on your dive equipment while whirling all around you… then they can suddenly change to be completely serene. It is this tranquility that I managed to record while sharing a small underwater cave with this cute little pup. It is rare in nature for a completely wild animal to demonstrate such trust in an unknown human, and I felt truly honored during this short interaction. Los Islotes, off the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.",

This place can be found in the Lofoten Archipelago at the small island named Sakrisøy. I've removed a small cabin in the left side during post process. Beside that, color correction, contrast and sharpness has been done in Lightroom and Photoshop.",

It's a festival in which the citizens are divided into two groups: the first is called the Enfarinat (the floured), that simulate a coup d'etat; the other one tries to calm down the rebellion. The teams plays with flour, water, eggs and coloured smoke bombs: the photos taken during the match are beautiful. It has been celebrated since 200 years and it's linked to the day of the massacre of innocents, when Herod, king of Judea, ordered to kill each baby in order to find Jesus.",

There are thousands strewn across the Yucatan, each with its own unique shape, size, depth and color. This was a challenging shot that required a long breath-hold so I could swim away from the light into the inky black cavern and wait for Julien to make his descent through the shards of light spilling in from above.",

            "description": "The most spectacular part of the historical Hungarian sports event, the 17th FINA World Championship is the high diving when competitors jump from an extreme heights: women jump from 20 meters, men from 27 meters. In the case of men, it means a 3 second free fall, and it carries huge risks of possible injuries therefore competitors have to reach the water feet first as during their speed can reach even 90 kms/hr. Each time jumpers are watched by light divers in the water so that they can provide assistance in case of trouble. This was the first time in the history of World Championships that competitors didn't jump in natural water but in an artificially built pool. The pool at the foot of the 34-meter high, 10-ton tower was built in the Danube's river bed on a 870 square meter concrete platform whose diameter is 15 meters with a 6 meter depth.",
